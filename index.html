    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and 
        typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
         standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
          printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
           type specimen book. <span> It has survived</span> not only five 
           centuries, but also the leap into electronic</p>
    <p>typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
         including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply 
        random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
        Latin words</p>
